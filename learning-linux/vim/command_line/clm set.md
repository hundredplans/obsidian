Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case

- :set ic - Ignores case
 
- :set hls - Turns on search highlighting found text
- :set is - Incremental search, as you type Vim matches to the content in real time
 
- :set inv - Toggle setting on/off
- :set no - Turn setting off
e.g. noic, invic will set ignore case off and toggle it respectively

It is not one thing but a collection of other things

# Intent
- Why do you care about something
- You're not gonna wake up early if there's no reason to
- Build up a WHY

# Resistance
- When you really want to do something but can't
- Comes from Emotions or [[Ahamkara]]

Ahamkara: View yourself as lazy, or a failure (decreases your motivation)

# Action
- Your brain breaks down big tasks into small tasks
- Healthy technology hygiene

# 2. Carry a note-book
- You can't remember it all, [Field Notes](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Field-Notes-Notebook-Composition-Fieldnotes/dp/B0BS8VKLJH/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=field+notes&qid=1687451646&sr=8-8) is good [[Active-Externalism]]
# 3. Calendars are Great
- Use [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar) to track Events, not Tasks
- Events are things you can miss if you forget them, they are not Tasks with a due-date. If it can be done before the due date it's a Task not an Event
# 4. [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)
- Acronym is GTD
- Splits Tasks into projects
- The Tasks have a context-tag which you can filter by, where/what they can be done on e.g laptop/work/school
- Tasks without this context-tag just serve to overwhelm us
# 5. Use Earplugs
- Maybe you have Sensory-Overload issues
- Don't even have to listen to anything, it can help you focus
# 6. In Face of Ambiguity, Ask
- If you're confused say "I'm sorry, I don't understand"
- If they continue, repeat "I don't understand"
- If you still don't understand say "I don't think you understand" how to communicate
- Ask for context to be included in what people ask of you, all relevant information should be inside the message
# 8. Store in Plain-Text
- Not the cloud, copy-paste into your brain for later linking
# 9. Do the __HARDEST__ Task first
- Don't let it loom over you while doing other easy things
# 10. Learn Triggers
- Triggers are what start us into doing something, learn to master this

# 16. [[Pomodoro-Technique]]
# 17. Humanize Organize Mechanize - How to build Systems

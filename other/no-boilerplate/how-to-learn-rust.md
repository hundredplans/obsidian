# Key Points
- Rust isn't difficult, it's unfamiliar
- Once you finish the Rust Book move on to Rustlings
- Rust difficulty is upfronted
# Important Resources
- [Rust Programming Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Brown University Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) (interactive exercises)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings - Exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- These resources are very tightly bounded together, designed for each other

# Side Quests
- [Ultralearning - Learning to Learn](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) __1__
- Read the Rust Book twice, first time read everything then re-read and work through the exercises __2__
- [Learn You A Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction) and or [Real World Haskell](https://book.realworldhaskell.org/) - Rust doesn't force you to use [[[Higher-Order-Functions]] and [[Immutability]] but it is recommended. Learn Haskell which does force you, and mostly read through the books quickly __3__

# Rustlings
- Install Rustlings using ```curl -l https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/rustlings/main/install.sh | bash``` to avoid missing dependencies
- Type hint to access the hint per level
- Re-do weekly if you want to remember

# How to learn Lifetime Annotations
- Don't use References, use Ownership and share nothing, pass variables to functions and return them if you need them
- Copy & Clone everything
- Obey the compilter, only use references when the compiler tells you

# How To
	- Haskell
- Read Rust Book once without noting or doing exercises
- Read Rust Book Brown University and do exercises
- Do Rustlings alongside Brown University book
- Read Rust by Example alongside Rustlings
- Redo favorite Rustlings exercises once you finish every week or so

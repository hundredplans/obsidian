You can think of subplots as coding indentations
You can have the Umbrella Plot, Subplot and Character Plot then only close Subplot and Character Plot in Book 1 but keep the Umbrella Plot until Book 2

You can make them relevant by making sure the reader is invested and engaged with POV character, they understand their motivations

# End vs Progress
Getting the reader to the [[End]] is more important than writing a fulfilling [[End]]
Examples include all the authors with weak endings but good in the middle such as [[Stephen King]]
Making progress is what makes the reader turn the page, [[Thriller]] are especially strong in this

# You Control Progress
Keep in mind this progress is imaginary, you have absolute control over it, think of [[Flashback]]
So it's on you to make the illusion that steady progress is happening towards an inevitable goal

# Progress Alignment
This progress doesn't have to be plot, it can be character development
Ask yourself why are people turning the page, what questions do they want answered
If your [[Promise]] and progress don't align you can change either to fit

# How To Create Progress
Small increments that show progress is happening
Doesn't always have to be forward sometimes you can backslide
Backsliding is more acceptable in romance's though for example
You HAVE TO indicate progress is happening or the reader will get annoyed that they're on a sidequest

The Monomyth
Really satisfying small steps of progress
All about relatable / triumphant moments
# Structure
- Character doesn't want to go on an adventure
- Called to adventure, refuse the call 
- Forced to adventure, into the unknown
- Trials and Tribulations, problems are popping up and the character overcomes it with a mentor
Mentor dies / dissapears
- Your buddies dissapear when you descend into the underworld / they metaphorically or literally die they are at their lowest point
- Moment of rebirth / redemption / atonement / make a new decision
- Rewarded with something 
- Go home with the reward and meet with divinity / your father now changed
- The hero is no longer a person who can stay home and often they just wander off

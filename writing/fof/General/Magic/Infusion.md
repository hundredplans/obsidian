Infusion is the act of putting mana into an object, it lets you apply the forces of Transform, Hold or Stick objects you control. Uninfusing is releasing the mana from an object, this will keep any momentum the object has. How hard an object is to infuse is completely dependant on the material's deviancy from an element, your distance to the object and its density. The elements are Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Thunder and Life. What this practically means is you will most often see Infusion on a base element or a close derivative. Whether the object is already Infused is also relevant to the difficulty of Infusion. It's almost impossible to Infuse an object already controlled by another mage. Multi-Infusion is possible, but usually only practiced within the same element, due to the complexity required to attend to multiple seperate elements.

Holding is how a mage controls an object they've Infused. You can feel the position of a Held object in your mind, and move it telepathically. Gestures are used most often, they help greatly newer mages in learning how to Hold an object and are hard to unlearn. Holding an object, moving it then Uninfusing is the primary method with which mages fight other mages. The object will continue with it's natural motion once Uninfused, it will not be stopped when in another mage's Aura as it's no longer Infused.

Transforming lets you change the state of an object, it's completely based on your understanding of the object. For example a Watermage that doesn't know ice freezes into water wouldn't be able to Transform water into ice. You can only Transform objects you've Infused, once you Transform an object you have the option to Lock the object. Locking the object prevents it from returning to it's natural state when Uninfused. If you don't Lock the object when you Uninfuse it will return to it's original state. For example a thrown ball of earth Transformed into wind for a second, never locked and Uninfused would create a shower of earth. Skin, aside from your own, is one of the hardest materials to Transform. The difficulty of Transforming an object is dependant on the original and target object's similarity to a base element. It is easiest to Transform between two base elements. Souls that are Transformed into existence and never Locked will vanish when you Uninfuse, this is akin to murder in Nolakan's eyes.

The last force is that of Stick. This allows you to attach the object you Infuse to another physical object. When the physical object moves so does the Infused. You can then Uninfuse the object and it will remain Stuck for a few seconds or minutes until the mana connecting the objects disperses. It's possible to Stick objects to anything, but it's the easiest and most common to do so with rigid objects. Sticking can be thought of as making the physical object Hold the Infused object in one position, always relative to itself.

# The Three Forces
- Transform
- Hold
- Stick

# Uninfusing
- When uninfused the object continues along it's motion
- If the object was not locked it will revert to it's base state instaenously
# Locking
- The act of preventing the material from changing back to it's original state when uninfused

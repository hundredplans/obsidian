Holy Shreevians act like gurus

i imagine when Shreev split New Shreev tried to escape the Stoneland's grasp but was colonised back eventually
new shreevians use the title Saint while holy shreevians use Monk

holy shreev, peaceful monks
new shreev, warrior monks

a guy who was exiled for reviving from shapeshifter land, now has become a Monk
Saint Jankali, who is now the leader of the Izgroi

Once a great empire under the name of The Milshreev Empire, Stoneland (under a different name back then) was a colony of theirs but eventually colonised them. Means that Zengef couldn't have fought Stoneland back in the end but the Milshreev Empire. They don't practice Fuyanism and don't believe in magic, Stoneland inherited a lot of their beliefs. Instead they believe in three gods, Ri, Ken and Riken. Ri is the God of change (war). Ken is the god of stability. Riken is the god of balance. After they split a lot happened but two new countries formed both claiming the title of Shreev. Holy Shreev which believe in Riken and New Shreev which believe in only Ri. Ken is unfortunately left out. The religion is called Rikenism.

The Jiha is the country that took over Milshreev, a colony and eventually conquered Milshreev

When Milshreev fell the Jiha generals took over the empire and distributed it among themself, which forms present day Jiralta, Dalanet, Holy Shreev, New Shreev, Manok and of course Stoneland

The Six Generals, two of which practiced Rikenism, three Fuyanists (Stoneland, Jiralta and Manok) and an atheist (Dalanet, who worship guns)

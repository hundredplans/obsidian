The Nation of Zengef began over 1,300 years ago, by the many clans who practiced magic due to the magic-rich area they lived in. In what is now known as the Manywar Period, the adjacent Milshreev Empire had already colonised most of Volin (which they later lost, see [[The Fall of Milshreev]]). They set their sights on the agricultural land of Zengef, and seeing the imminent threat the clan chiefs banded together to defend the invasion. Brutal skirmishes set mostly on the Vitaf River for over 10 years saw the formation of a national identity, the Zengef, believed to mean "river warriors" or "those who fight for the river" in the Lost Tongue (lost around 800 years ago). Even at the time the Zengefians saw Fuyan as the pursuit of the mastery of magic, whether it's unwinding the intricacies or applications in battle.

As the war continued a base of operations was established at two locations, Enkefen and Castellum Fort. Enkefen was chosen for its remote location on an easy to defend island that allowed easy access to the mainland. Castellum Fort was nearby the Vitaf River and naturally developed as an outpost to garrison soldiers. In one of the Manywars, the Milshreev Empire gained a foothold and they managed to capture Enkefen and what is now Carielam, Tafos and Pulfes (Castellum Fort). Once a counterattack was mounted by the Zengef, the enemy War General ordered the city burned and razed to the ground. Only ruins were left and a new city was later constructed, even grander and taller located on the Claw. In honor of Enkefen, through which it was birthed, the city was named High Enkefen. The spirits of the Zengefian soldiers was reignited and they pushed back the Shreevians to the Vitaf River and won a resounding victory at the Battle of Mudfoot. In Zengefian classrooms this is often taught as the end of the Manywar, the Shreevians cowed and recuperating. The truth is that shortly after the battle the Emperor and General (Zengef had no real government at this time) signed the Formation Pact, named so as it it was the first international recognition of Zengef as a country. The War General who razed Enkefen was executed on counts of genocide. The Zengefians in turn established the Prasedi government. Rules were established by the pact, the most relevant being: Two Shreevians officials had to listen to all Prasedi council discussions, Vitaf Island was handed over to the Milshreev Empire and invasion of the Milshreev Empire was prohibited alongside the creation of an "Army that could threaten the peace between the two nations".

With the conclusion of the 70 year long Manywar, there was time for real development. Thus came the 1,200 year long Kesse Period (believed to be the Lost Tongue word for growth). The Prasedi saw the formation of the duchy system, establishing five duchies which were almost autonomous but taxed by the government. The dukes and the lords under them became known as Magelords due to the proclivity of strong magic users often being in these positions, but it is not required for one to be magically talented to become a Magelord. Due to the lack of a strong central army, each Magelord took it upon themself to defend their land and so most Magelords possessed (and still do) a strong personal army of mages typically in the hundreds and sometimes thousands for Dukes or the most powerful of regular Magelords. Ducats were introduced as the currency. High Enkefen was built and chosen as the capital. Fang Island was established as a sacred location and the indigenous Monachus people were left undisturbed, now willingly providing spiritual help to those seeking it. The Seamages was agreed to be established as strictly a sea-based army and Seastorm Island was chosen as the headquarters despite it's less favorable location to Perdif Island (Enkefen Ruins) which were declared sacred grounds. Near the end of the period, Zengef was one of the biggest advocators for the formation of the World Conference and joined at its conception.

The incredibly long period of relative peace was broken by the Blood Invasions (see Kaluta/Blood Invasions), extensive use of soulstone by the Blood Mages saw it outlawed within the country except for use by the Seamages and later the Mage Army of Zengef. The Blood Invasions were succesfully defended, but caused instability across the country. Mellisa Waterblood was discovered as a traitor by Arengash Earthblood. She was a attempting a coup for Dalanet in 2931PD and was executed, thus began the rising tensions between the two countries. In 2948PD, Dalanet decided to invade Tenos with great force. After 4 months of fighting the Battle of Tenos began and was a staggering victory which concluded the invasion. Magelords and notable Great Masters such as Clypef Earthblood, Pakafesh Waterblood and Kyon who fought in place of his dying master Tonitrus Thunderblood and became the Thunderblood after him. 20,000 Zengefian soldiers died alongside Clypef, who sacrified himself for the lives of 8 soldiers. A retaliation invasion was launched on the Sang Peninsula by Zengef in 2952PD, it was led by Tomin Windblood and was defended by Dalanet in only 21 days. The two countries were at a stalemate for 17 years, mostly engaging in naval warfare. This stalemate was resolved when Lakiffi was brought to justice, a vile mafia boss who run from the Dalanet authorities to Zengef and hid in Mercaju. He was killed by Kalissa Fireblood, who discovered him by accident. She brought his head to Dalanet and acting unofficially, began negotations for a peace treaty with Dalanet. Prasedi, who saw the war as unnecessary but were unwilling to be the first to start the peace negotations took this as an opening and continued the talks. Thus the Dalanet-Zengef Peace was signed in 2969PD alongside the formation of the United Nations of Volin consisting of only Zengef and Dalanet.

Lafef's Coup (2973PD-2974PD) is the next influential event. It saw to the establishement of the Mage Army of Zengef, the death of influential figures such as Kalissa Fireblood and the passing of the Free Government Act which prohibits government officials from practicing magic. The newly established Mage Army violated the Formation Pact, and the Stoneland Empire, a descendant of the Milshreev Empire, retaliated and began attacking the shores of the Vitaf River once more. In 2982PD Roroni joined the UNOV and is to date the only country to do so. The Battle of Thousand Flames (2986PD) is the most impactful battle of the ongoing skirmishes, led by a famed War General, Crazy Roznoi, it was won by Jolanan Fireblood working together with his granddaughter, a young teenage girl who is now known as Boomrock Epi, one of the Mage Army Commanders. A mage rebel group which calls itself the Freemages began a riot (2991PD) in Undatif. It was stopped by Rakinji Windblood extinguishing the flames and bringing order by echoing his voice to all corners of the city.

Watermen in Pustan villages named different things across the countries but all they can do is create water

They see other forms of magic as only via artifacts as a culture, and see regular unchanneled magic as dangerous due to the Shifting Sands. Except they don't see the Watermen as using magic

The Shifting Sands, a magic catastrophe a few thousand years ago that permanently altered the mana of a huge swathe of land in Pustan and changing their culture forever. The creatures there are supercharged on mana and even a person said to stay in the Shifting Sands too long will come out and act a different man. It is called the Shifting Sands as even the ground has so much mana it is prone to changing. It is believed no men live in the Shifting Sands but there are some crazy few tribes that reside within.

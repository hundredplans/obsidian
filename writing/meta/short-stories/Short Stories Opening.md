The opening is where you meet your characters and make promises for the reader
The reader wants to be oriented

In your first three sentences:
- Who, their action, what are they doing, the action they're taking / reflection, character thinking about something specific
- Where, link to a sensory detail "The chatter of the guards manning the walls"
- Genre, a genre-specific detail something specific and unique to the genre

You can use a shorthand for the character, that gives you an idea what their attitude is such as:
- Sexist Boss
- Arrogant Teenager
- Spunky Pirate

The important part is defining their attitude
Conflict should be given within the first thirteen lines

What is your character trying to do and why? (Yes, but / No, and)
What is the barrier?

Who, Where, Genre -> In any order
Set-up for try/fail, what is your character trying to do?
What is stopping them?
Five sentences on introducing the [[Conflict]], try-fail cycle, achieve a goal and fail it
Five sentences on resolving the [[Conflict]], (Yes, And / No, But)
Who, Where, Genre / Mood -> In any order for the ending, grounds the reader (Mood, where your character is emotionally, if place changed show where the new place is)

If you start with two [[MICE Quotient]] elements, you can establish two problems at the beginning instead, or introduce the other one later

Establish Who, Where, Genre regardless of the size


Example Story
I grappled to the side of the rollercoaster, my jockey training prepared me for this. The screams of the crowd pounded in my ears. "Engaging Warp Core Drive", I braced myself. I could already feel the marble trophy for the best rollercoaster jockey in the palm of my hand. I could marry Misandra then, I just have to defeat the blasted Warp Core. I pressed a hand to the front of the rollercoaster, fingers touching the control screen. "A trolley is on a track. There is one man on one side of the track and five man which the trolley will kill if it continues unimpeded. Do you press a lever to change the trolley's trajectory?". I don't know, what kind of blasted question is that? My jockey training never covered this! I panic and run out of time, the trolley runs over the single man. "Light Speed Warp Core Activated". I cling on for all my life is worth. Not a lot apparently I realise as I fall off the rollercoaster. As I pummel towards the ground I hear the crowd erupt in noise, something about the winner, lucky guy. I feel the wind knocked out of me, and im almost instantly picked up by two black-clad men. They raise my arms and the crowd goes wild, I hear the announcer boom through the crowd "You've survived the longest young man, the Marble Trophy is yours!". I let the crowds shouts wash over me, Misandra, my love. With the Marble Trophy, she will marry the greatest rollercoaster jockey to ever goddamn exist.

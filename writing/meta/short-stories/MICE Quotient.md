[[Millieu Conflict]]
[[Inquiry Conflict]]
[[Character Conflict]]
[[Event Conflict]]

Most stories are made up of multiple threads, single thread stories are really boring
You do this by nesting, when you open millieu and inquiry then you have to close inquiry before closing millieu

If you don't properly nest your stories might feel like they end multiple times

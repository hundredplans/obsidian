The author's job is to figure out what the character needs to do and systematically prevent them from reaching the goal

When that goal is reached, the story is over
Try-Fail Cycle

When something fails, try a different approach

Yes, but -> They made progress in their goal but were pushed back
No, and -> They didn't make progress in their goal and were pushed back

Resolution is:
Yes, And -> Movement towards the goal and a continuation towards the goal
No, But -> There was a reversal but they still get something towards the goal

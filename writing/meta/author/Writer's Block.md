If your [[Plot]] and [[Character Arc]] don't align the best thing you can do is finish the story
By the time you finish the chapter, you can then *fix* it
Overtime you gain an intuition how to align them
Your job is not to write a great novel, it's to become a person who can write a great novel

If still a problem, break down into the components of a story such as [[Plot Archetype]], [[Character Arc]], Motivations, [[Progress]] etc

# Yes/No/And/But
Throw a character into a terrible situation
Make them figure out what the smartest thing to get out of the problem is

If it works
- You add a but, something else has gone wrong
else:
- Escalate the problem to a bigger problem

With this something is always going wrong for the character
Afterward you can go back and move all of it into pieces of a larger plot with foreshadowing

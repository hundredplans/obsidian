Half or more of the power of description is through [[Characterisation]]
Covered a lot by [[Pyramid of Abstraction]]

A character who's humorous in their description is more likeable
Every description should say something about the [[Character]]
Will say something about the character doing the describing and the one being described

Sometimes you can afford to be a little omniscient and just describe a thing as it is

Can Characterise by making the description seen by the goal they're pursuing
So a thirsty character everything will be described by how watery it is

# Establishing Shots
- It's the movie pan that establishes the location
- The first name the reader sees is which head they will assume they're in
- A good technique is to tell the temperature and how the character feels about the temperature
- Senses are good at the beginning of setting a scene

White room syndrome occurs the longer your character talks without interacting with the setting -> Relates directly to [[Pyramid of Abstraction]]

# The Senses
- You have five senses to work with
- You will most likely overrely on sight

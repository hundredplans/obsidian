An action accompanied with [[Dialogue]]
So something the person does eg: "Scratched his face", "Slammed the table"
More beats is slower, the subtext does the heavylifting over the Dialogue`
[[Pyramid of Abstraction]] -> Beats can be used as the ground of the pyramid

How often you use beats is stylistic
Some writers write a beat almost every line of Dialogue
Others only use a little bit to keep you grounded

Fewer beats forces you to write better Dialogue -> The reader will fill in the beats in their head

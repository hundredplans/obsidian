Active way to convey information and [[Characterisation]]
Avoid having dialogue sound like a monologue
- Don't have big dialogue chunks then reaction then big dialogue chunk into reaction

Has to read more like a conversation, with points being refuted and considered (When you want to infodump) -> Feels more like it's expressing character

# Expressing Proactivity
- Excited to talk about something
- Meaningful contributions / Offer help
# Expressing Motivation
- "Oh, my son" in the middle of a conversation
# Expressing Flaws
- Stubborn, to make the [[Character Arc]] you can make them change over time
- Say something stupid
- Asking insightful questions then later giving information as a [[Character Arc]]
- Not say something when they should
# Expressing Competence
- If a character acknowledges something it's reinforced
- Cut through the fluff and get to the core
- To establish non-competence, have a "I didn't know"
- Ask asinine questions
- Humor where it's not appropriate[[]]

# Varying Dialogue
- Based on character
- Aggressive vs Non-Aggressive stance
- Character who wants more information vs Who just wants to do a thing
- Dialect use -> Less is more, you don't need nearly as many as you think you do
- Heavy dialect use -> Readers eyes will glaze over (you need to give context clues)
- Variety is king, you want to mix between monologue, argument, calm talk, shooting the shit

Can practice dialogue by writing a three-person or more conversation with no attributions
Then you can add the tags in and the dialogue will read very well

"Wiki History" and "They Are Made of Meat" both do this well

# Rule of Thumb for Attributions
- Bookisms at the end (Said/Asked/Shouted/Whispered/Noted) 90% of attributions, they don't draw focus away from the Dialogue
- Scale back if it's only two people with back and forths
- With three people use more tags than you think you need, or the third person will be jarring
- Avoid adverbs / Be sparing / Use to modify tone (Softly, Loudly)
- If you don't lean on attributions, your Dialogue will be sharper (by replacing adverbs for example)

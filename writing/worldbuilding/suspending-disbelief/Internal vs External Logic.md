Internal Logic is really important for most stories, some comic stories can get away with not
Important even for soft magic
You try not to break your own rules

Internal Logic is why things happen even if it doesn't make sense physically, by rules established by the author

External Logic is why things are happening to someone who understands physics
[[Soft vs Hard Magic]]

Adding a little bit of External Logic can help people suspend their disbelief
A magic system won't feel like magic is you add a lot of external logic / You can play into the genre conventions such as a human mask in a spy thriller

When Internal and External clash often Internal is the best choice
If you go against people's expectations, you need to put extra work into it

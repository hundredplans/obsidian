The reader should be able to tell you did a lot of worldbuilding but you never show it on the page

But what you really should is have a hollow iceberg, where if you look into the water you think a lot of worldbuilding went on but it's all imaginary

You simply don't have time, so you learn to fake it

Do only what you absolutely need for the story

If you get small details right, the reader will assume you get everything else right

Or if you get one thing right, so the reader believes the rest of it is there

A continum of problem-solving with magic / magic with science to a sense of wonder 

It's good to be about 75% towards hard magic on that continum with the first book and fill in over time

Soft vs Hard Magic essentially
# Soft Magic
- You don't know the consequences or even the cost of using the magic
- You can't predict the ramifications or effect
- Most of the time the POV character is not using it / it's a device
- You can use this to make characters without the magic feel small / out of their depth

Hard magic doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't make sense, the reader just has to understand what it does [[Internal vs External Logic]]

Worldbuild through the eyes of the character
Avoid [[Tell then Show]]
Avoid [[Passive Voice]]

Get rid of descriptors that don't pull you down the [[Pyramid of Abstraction]], such as:
- Very Mad vs Irate
- Stumble a little bit vs Stumble
This will ground your reader in a world that feels very real

If you want the reader to believe you in the big things, you describe one small thing that impacts the characters

Saying "This place is bad" vs Showing the person having a bad experience at the place

Start with your character in a situation where they want something, they can't have it, and they work proactively to get the thing they want. This is to ground us on a scene, you only use as much worldbuilding as you need to ground the reader

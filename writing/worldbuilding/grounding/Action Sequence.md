For action the reader needs to be able to place the important components
You can treat action sequences as mini arcs

Start off by showing character motivation
Character making a plan / What the progress will be
- Examples are: Get to the end of the hallway, count dead guys
What is the payoff if the character reaches the end

Progress can change the status quo -> Example is reinforcements come

Ask yourself what your suprises and twists are
What issues / narrative turns / new information will happen

# Ways to Explain Jargon
- Teach it throughout the story
- Summarise it in some form -> Example is Robert Jordan with the sword forms
- Running commentatry by either another character or your character
- Dialect with summaries to explain to the reader
- Subgenre can help to let the reader pick up on it

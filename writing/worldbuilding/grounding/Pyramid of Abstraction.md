The goal of your descriptions if to form the base of a pyramid, to ground the reader into the story

So when you start talking about things that are more high-level / abstract, which pulls the reader out of the story, you can have the abstract (tip of pyramid) be earned by laying the base of the pyramid (worldbuilding)

How abstract something is can be tested by checking how many people imagine the same thing when you give a description, for example dog and love are abstract as people imagine different things

If you give a specific description of a dog however it's more concrete

More words in a description = more concrete

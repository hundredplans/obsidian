[[Worldbuilding in Service of Story]]
[[Sando-Outlines]]

Pick one major [[Physical Setting]] and spiral into a bunch of [[Physical Setting]] offshoots, like Stormlight
Pick a couple of [[Cultural Setting]] and really focus on them, you have 100 points to build your [[Cultural Setting]], the number of points you get is dependant on the genre (Epic Fantasy more than Urban)

Your [[Setting]] should enhance your story by expanding on the aspects of the genre

Your major Setting does not have to all interconnect, example Gender Roles in Roshar which creates new interconnections

Taboos are very interesting, such as safehands, which are explained historically by a philosopher saying all woman arts are one handed and male are two handed

Your ability to solve problems with magic in a satisfying way is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic

Basically don't do magic [[Deus Ex Machina]]
You feel satisfied when you give the reader tools to solve problems and then the character uses those tools

Rely on character's quick wits to apply the tool to different situations

Law of Foreshadowing essentially, you have to foreshadow new abilities

If you don't want to solve problems in a satisfying way don't use this law

When it works -> You could have known and figured out what could have happened at the end ahead of time

You need to understand what the setup is "I feel like if i can solve this problem with the magic i will receive a dump of understanding that will let me solve the day", reader is fine because your [[Promise]] has [[Payoff]]

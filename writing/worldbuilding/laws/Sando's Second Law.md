Flaws/limitations/costs are more interesting than powers

The most interesting superman stories are those in which his powers can't solve the problem

Either
- Your character is not skilled enough with their magic and needs to level up (Flaw)
- Find something that is not working in the magic and fix it (Flaw)
- The magic is not working right now what do i do, i have to use my other attributes (Limitation)
# Flaws
Your character's flaws and limitations, the things they're willing to do and not and the costs of actions, are where the story will happen about your characters

Things the character could change, either if they apply themself or understand themself

With magic, it can be things you don't understand yet, that can be fixed with more effort e.g Elantris
# Limitations
You work with it rather than fix it
For characterization it can be something like you're born with one arm, it's not something you can fix
A person with a handicap needs to work within the handicap to achieve what they want to do, works the same way for magic
# Cost
If character/magic takes an action what is the cost to them physically/mentally/emotionally, can set up that if they take an action it will cost them

A resource cost, such as Stormlight, is fun because it can add [[Tension]], can be tied into economy or a social dimension (rich characters can use magic more)

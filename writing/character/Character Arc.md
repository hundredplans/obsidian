[[Iconic Characters]] do not need a character arc

Most arcs involve reassesing goals (Want vs Need)
Coming to understand the Need and giving up the Want

Follow a [[Three Act Structure]] often
- Establishes the flaw without noticing it
- Change from inactive to active about their flaw
- Relapse on their flaw -> Darkest moment / All is lost
- Internal conflict aligns with external conflict (They give up their Want and realise the Need will accomplish the plot) / (Contrast where they have to lapse into their flaw usually for tragedy)

Sometimes you can have a book where it ends with the character acknowledging they need to work on it

A person's background, [[Personality]] and [[Character Motivation]] should influence their descriptions and diction

You want the actual dialog to do the heavy lifting not the contents around it:
"Im not happy with you" he said angrily VS "How dare you!"
Cut the adverb and make the diction express the emotion

If you can practice one skill it is to make the dialog snap off the page

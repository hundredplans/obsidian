To make your character feel real, don't write them into a Role
Every character is the protagonist of their own story
They see themself as the main character
They have hopes and dreams that would have continued existing without the main plot

Who are the characters, and who would they have become if the main plot didn't whisk them away

The less time you have with a character, the more difficult it is to not write them to a role

What is the character trying to accomplish before the plot happens, and how are they trying to work into what the plot is doing, how do they have a personal connection to the plot

Goals over Motivation
Goal = Win the championship
Motivation = Why they want to win the championship

Goals can shift while motivations become the core of the character

When you write yourself into a situation where your character isn't the type of person to do what you want them to do you can:

- Rebuild the story to fit who the character has become
- Or the character can take over the story and turn it into something different

You can rebuild the outline to match the character or rewrite the charater
Often you want to rebuild the outline

First impressions are really important, if you show the character is proactive in their own sphere, you can make them not understand their motivations / not want to go out and still have the reader care for them

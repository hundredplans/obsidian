Need [[Promise]] and [[Character Arc]] too
When in someone's POV you have to treat them as the [[Main Character]]

For characters that only appear in one scene -> Give only one identifying characteristic, that doesn't fit into their Role (Write them to a personality not the role)

To make a non viewpoint character that the main character doesn't understand the motivations of interesting can be done by:
- Hanging a lantern on it, eg Side Character says "You don't get them" and MC replies "I totally do" and SC replies "You will be embarassed in the future for saying that"
- Avoid [[Gorrila in Phone Booth]]
- You want to show the reader that it's not a flaw in the story, makes them feel smart for noticing

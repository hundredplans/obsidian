[[Care for Characters]]

- Show that they are like us / relatable
- Make them nice, if you want someone to like a hero you have them save a cat and if you want someone to hate a villain you have them kick a dog
- To humanise a villain you can show them doing something like a normal person would
- Show people liking them, someone who is liked by others will be liked, a character having family or having friends

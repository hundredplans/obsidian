[[Sando's First Law]] -> Motivation needs to be established so when they make a decision it should be inline with who they are

To fix this (if the character is acting contrary to their motivations) you either have to revise the scene or establish a motivation

Characters can have conflicting motivations that drive us in different directions
Often comes from the intersection of social/business/family/religious life

If you show this intersection readers won't feel the character is acting against their motivation

You want more than one character motivation, or the character will become one note, whose emotional state does not change

You can have one motivation if there's a lot of progress being made

There are three ways to make a reader care about a character

[[Establish Empathy]]
[[Establish Rooting Interest]]
[[Establish Progress]]

You can do all three, or you can do one of three very well

A magic system is only as interesting as the characters using it, if you don't care who lives and dies
Setting is only as interesting in how it causes problems for the characters

[[Sliding Scales]]

[[Sanderson's Laws]] can be used with this model too

[[Character Motivation]]

# Likability
[[Establish Empathy]]
## Up
- Humorous
## Down
- Whiney
- Argumentative
- Not paying attention
- Making fun of people
# Proactivity
Proactivity -> Motivation / What they are doing to achieve that motivation [[Establish Rooting Interest]]
Someone high on Proactivity that doesn't change usually has a good motivation
A change in character motivation can signify a change in proactivity
# Competence
Competence -> How competent they are in an area related to the plot / [[Establish Progress]]
Competence can be dependant on an area, so different sliding scales for different areas
Often interweaved with a change of proactivity
# Other
Are three sliding scales used to make the reader care about them

Moving a character on any of these scales creates [[Progress]], even downwards (less Likeable for example)

[[Iconic Characters]] can avoid these and will have one, two or even three of these cranked to the top

A lot of motion on these scales on all the characters make a typically engaging story

A lot of villains are not Likeable but Proactive and Competent (such as Frazier)

Having a lot of characters with different high ends of these scales is engaging

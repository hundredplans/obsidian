#### Explanation 
1. Mixture of chemical compounds that prevent [[Oxidation]]
2. Can be applied in paste or powder form before welding or using flux-coated [[Filler Rods]] while welding

#### Advantages 
1. Collects impurities and brings them to the surface of the metal
2. Releases gases when heated which prevent [[Oxidation]]
3. Can help to start and maintain an electric arc, [[Electric Arc Welding]]

#### Disadvantages
1. [[Slag]] layer is formed which needs to be chipped off if appearance is important
2. Produce smoke which is hazardous to the welder
3. Complex and expensive

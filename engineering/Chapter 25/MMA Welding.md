# General
1. Also called Manual Metal Arc or "Stick" welding
2. Manual process
3. Typically used for [[Heavy-Gauge Metals]] as it burns [[Light-Gauge Metals]]
4. Leaves [[Slag]] on the weld

# How to use
1. A gun holds a [[Filler Rods]] that is [[Flux]]-Coated or uses a consumable [[Electrode]] that is [[Flux]]-Coated
2. The stick is brought close to the metal a hot electric arc forms
3. [[Flux]] and filler metal drops into the weld area
4. [[Slag]] is created on top of the metal

# Advantages
- Easy to learn 
- [[Slag]] slows down the cooling of the weld, preventing [[Brittle Joints]]
- [[Slag]] indicates impurities have been removed from the weld
- Can be used in windy conditions using a portable power supply

# Disadvantages
- [[Slag]] has to be chipped off after cooling
- Not suitable for [[Light-Gauge Metals]]
- Produces a lot of [[Fumes]]
- Can only weld short distances
- Stick needs to be changed frequently

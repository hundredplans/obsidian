# Unorganized Notes
Reaction + Friction + Gravity = 0

Measure 10 spaces (with ruler) = 0.2 seconds 
50 Dots = 1 Seconds in Ireland
d = tv (you can get velocity)

Even spaces between each dot = constant velocity
Spreading dots = accelerating

10 spaces from start of ticker tape = u (11 dots)
10 spaces from end of ticker tape = v (11 dots)

Everything in middle is s

Graph is A on left, F on bottom. Slope = m

If graph doesn't go through (0, 0). Adjust the track or grease the wheels

Metre stick might be damaged 
Boyle's Law do slowly to allow the gas to stay the same as the same temperature

Bottom of the ball to the trapdoor is the distance s in the gravity by freefall experiment

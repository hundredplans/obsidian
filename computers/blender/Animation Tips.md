- Name TPose `_TPose` so it's at the top for Godot

- Shield (Fake User) icon stops auto-deletion if an animation isn't linked to an object

- Press A Select all bones then press I - Location, Rotation & Scale for all animations, otherwise I think they won't move the bones between animations correctly

- Click record button at bottom of screen to auto-hotkey

- Shift-Left Arrow goes to first frame

- You can remove Specular Lighting from Viewport settings to see object easier

- For a looping animation set End Key-Frame to your (last key-frame - 1) and duplicate the starter key-frames at the end for smooth looping

- Select all bones and all keyframes then press Shift-E Make Cyclic (F-Modifier) for any looping animation

- Ctrl-Tab to go into graph editor

- F before animation name indicates Shield (Fake User) is activated

- Ctrl-Shift-V pastes keyframes mirrored

- Decent workflow is to do key-frames that are far apart then go through each key-frame and see if the motion checks out in-between, if it doesn't add more

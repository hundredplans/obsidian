"Memory is the residue of thought"

# Types of Forgetting
## Decay
- Gradual over time forgetting
- The inevitable passing of time

## Interference
- Proactive: You want to learn something but already have muscle memory built up
- Retroactive: Your old information is erased/supressed by new information

## Forgotten Cues
- You haven't forgotten, the knowledge is locked
- You need a cue to remember again
- Suggests relearning is faster than learning

# Memory Retention Mechanisms
## Spaced Learning 
- Spreads learning over a long period of time
- SRS (Spaced-Repetition-Software) is good for this
- Once you learn the skill practice it every week/month
    - Refresher projects
    - Direct practice

## Proceduralization
- Harder to forget muscle memory
- Emphasise a core set of information (drills)

## Overlearning
- Increases how long memories are stored
- Continuous refining of core skills
- Works well with extensive projects
- Do a more advanced task so what you want to learn becomes a core skill

## Mnemonics
- Hyperspecific to a certain pattern
- Converts a core concept to a mental image
- Requires a significant up-front cost to learn a mnemonic system
- Always slower than free recall
- Good for remembering dense information for a weeks/months

# How to employ Drills?
- Identify what you are bad at and do intentional, designed practice
## Direct then Drill
- To isolate bottlenecks found in your Direct Learning
- Can also be used to learn things you don't have the time to learn
- After doing these Drills go back to direct and integrate what you learnt
    - This lets you see if the Drill was effective
- If you are early into your learning these Direct then Drill cycles can be quick

# When to Drill?
- What aspect, when improved, would increase your efficiency the most?
- Apply Direct then Drill to what you hypothesise is bottlenecking you

# How to Drill?
- Isolate a point in a large slice and drill it
- Isolate a component/skill and drill it
- Copy what you don't want to drill and drill one component
    - Can use this with your past works
- Spend an unproportional amount of time on the skill when employing it
- Start with a hard task and when you fail drill each component

# When not to Drill?
- No context for why you're drilling
- When you don't have any bottlenecks

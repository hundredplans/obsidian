"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth"

# Overly Negative/Positive Feedback
- Generally bad as it lowers your motivation
- Don't overreact to feedback that doesn't help you improve
    - Wastes your energy
    - Builds your ego in any direction

# Fear of Feedback
- Often more uncomfortable than the feedback itself

# Types of Feedback
## Outcome Feedback (Are you doing it wrong?)
- How well you are performing not how you can improve
- Can be considered a Progress Bar
- Shows you if your learning method is working

## Informational Feedback (What are you doing wrong?)
- Specific what you are doing wrong but not how to fix it
- Can be self-provided
- Pairs well with Directness

## Corrective Feedback (How are you doing it wrong?)
- Can be unreliable as people can be wrong
- Pay for a tutor to get this sort of feedback

# When to listen to feedback?
- If you consistently receive the same feedback it's most likely true
- Immediatelly if you can instantly correct your mistake
    - Can backslide into getting feedback before you tried your best

# Upgrading Feedback
## General
- Can backfire if the feedback-giver hasn't thought about it
- Corrective feedback requires:
    - An expert
    - A correct answer to exist
## Noise Cancellation
- Reduce the useless feedback
- Listen to data not human feedback
## Difficulty Sweet-Spot
- If you hit the sweet-spot your self provided feedback improves
## Rapid Feedback
- Get a lot of feedback constantly to see which feedback is consistent 
- Can provoke you to learn more aggressively

# Feedback Mistakes
- Processing feedback as ego
- Avoiding feedback punches

# Types of Experimentation
## With Resources (How can I learn?)
- Discover which resources work best for you
- Pick a new resource and apply it rigorously for a week
- Evalute if it works and if it's worth to continue learning
## With Technique (What should I learn next?)
- Pick a subtopic and drill it using a technique
- If it doesn't stick change technique
## With Style (How can I be unique?)
- Be aware of different styles that exist
- Discuss with other experts that utilize unique styles
- Dissect other experts styles

# Growth Mindset
- Those who believe can't change remain stuck
- Your learning style strengths and weaknesses are not immutable
- You can improve your abilities in many ways

# How to Experiment?
## General

- Discard the methods that don't work
## Copy then Create
- Simplifies your choice for experimentation
- Deconstruct why what you copied works
- Highlight what is/isn't important to the skill
## Compare Methods
- Use the scientifc method, change one variable and measure the results
- Limiting to one variable let's you understand what works

## Introduce Constraints
- Introduce new constraints that limit your old methods
- Best innovations come from constraints
## Utilize Past Skills
- Combine what you've already learnt and have an advantage in with what you're learning
## Explore the Extremes
- Go extreme to give yourself a broader range of experience

# Why Experiment?
- Determine when to be direct
- Determine when to drill

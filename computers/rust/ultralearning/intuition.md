"Do not ask whether a statement is 
true until you know what it means"

# How to develop intuition?
## Do not give up on hard problems
- Set a struggle timer for 5/10 mins when you want to give up
- More likely to remember solution even if you fail
## Prove Things
- Easy to misbelieve you understand something
- Slow as you have to repeat/reinvent existing processes
## Concrete Example
- Applies theory directly
- If concrete examples don't exist create them
- If you can't form an example you don't understand it well enough
    - Go back and re-learn the material
## Ask Questions
- Ask questions to test your understanding
- Even if they are dumb questions

# Feynman Technique
## How to use it
- Use when you barely/don't understand an idea
1. Write down the concept at the top of an empty page
2. Below pretend you're explaining the idea to someone else
    - If it's a concept convey the idea
    - If it's a problem explain how to solve it and why the solution makes sense
3. If you get stuck go back to the learning material then re-try
## Applications
### Don't understand at all
- Do it with the book in hand
### You can't solve a problem
- Go through the problem step by step with an explanation
- Do not summarize, you might skip core difficulties of the problem
### Expanding your Intuition
- Creative illustrative examples
- They need to be clear to someone who doesn't understand
- Don't teach the idea, explain it
- Ponder how you can make something confusing obvious

# Do your research
- Ensures you don't have to change plans mid-way
- Create a checklist
## Checklist
- What you are learning and the scope
    - Start with a narrow well-defined scope that can be achieved
- Have you collected your primary resources
    - Choose your starting point from one of these resources
- Have you identified how others learnt this skill?
- Do you know how you will use this skill directly?
- Have you prepared backup materials?
    - Do this to not overwhelm yourself at the start

# Schedule your time
## Starting 
- Decide how much time you will invest up-front
- Create a weekly schedule on a calendar
## Best Methods
- Shorter learning chunks are better for retention
- Use longer chunks for programming & writing as they require warm-up
- Practice how much warm-up time you need and how focused you are during it
- Start with a short ultra-learning project to stay motivated
## Long Projects
- If your project is 6 months or longer
- Break down into sub-projects
- Do a pilot of 1 week first to test if you can stay on schedule
    - If you're burned out change schedule
- Create a calendar to stay motivated

# How to execute your plan
- Remember no plan is perfect
## Metalearning
- Have I benchmarked?
- Have I interviewed experts?
- Have I spent 10% of my total learning time researching?
## Focus
- Am I procrastinating?
- How long does it take me to warm-up?
- How long do I stay focused?
- Should my attention be intense or creative?
## Directness
- Am I missing anything from how people use this skill directly?
- How can I practice knowledge transfer from resources to direct?
## Drill
- Am I drilling?
- What is bottlenecking me?
- Do I have any specific weaknesses?
- Can I split the complex components of my skill into drills?
## Retrieval
- Am I solving problems or reading?
- Am I word vomitting?
- Am I testing myself?
- Can I remember what I learnt a week/month ago?
## Feedback
- Am I taking punches early?
- Do I know what I'm not learning?
- Am I overreacting to noise?
## Retention
- Do I have a plan to remember this long-term?
- Am I spacing my exposure to information?
- Am I creating procedures?
- Am I overlearning the core skills?
## Intuition
- Am I just memorizing or do I understand deeply?
- Could I teach this to someone else?
- Is it clear why what I'm learning is useful?
## Experimentation
- Am I getting stuck with my current resources?
- Do I need to try new approaches?
- How can I create a unique style?

# Review your Resources
- After finishing or pausing a project
- What went right/wrong
- How can you avoid the same mistakes?
- Don't blame willpower or motivation, the issue is often systemic
- Analyze your successes, not just your failures, understand what worked

# Post-Learning Strategies
## Maintain
- Sustain the skill but not elevate it
- Use a habit of regular practice
- Integrate the skill into your life
- Start with serious practice and reduce it as you remember more
## Mastery
- Continue learning at a lighter pace or another ultra-learning project
- Topics which require accumulation of knowledge can be casual
- Topics where you can get stuck benefit from ultra-learning
## Relearning
- Use a refresher course when you need to re-learn the skills again

# Alternatives to Ultralearning
## Low-Intensity Habits
- Can be spontaenous, casual and fun
- All you need to do is show up
- Best suited for skills which require a slow accumulation of knowledge
## Formal/Strucutred
- Acquires credentials
- Creates a beneficial learning environment
## Where does Ultralearning outshine them?
- Where barrier to entry is very high
- Unlearning ineffective behaviour
- If you want to have fun be good at a skill

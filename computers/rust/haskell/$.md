- Stands for Function Application (somehow)
- Basically the pipe operator
- Used to remove parantheses
- Apply the expression on the right as a parameter to the function on the left
- Has very low precedence, so it gets called last
- Right associative, first $ called will be from the right side

sum (map sqrt [1..130])
sum $ map sqrt [1..130]

f (g (z x))
f $ g $ z x

- In general just makes things look much prettier

map ($ 3) [(4+), (10\*), (^2), sqrt]  
[7.0,30.0,9.0,1.7320508075688772]

- Apply 3 to each value

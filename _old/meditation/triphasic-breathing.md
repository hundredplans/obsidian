Begin by breathing in through your nose and expanding your belly
Move on to expanding your belly and passing it through your chest
Then start dropping your chest breahting before dropping your belly breathing
Next just breathe in with your belly, chest and shoulders
Now breathe in with your belly, chest then shoulders and stop breathing in with your shoulders, chest then belly
Do the last step for 5-10 breaths (10 seconds each)
Just sit with how you are breathing after you finish your breaths with your eyes closed
Slowly come back, put your hands your knees
Rub your palms together, put them over you eyes, breathe in and exhale then open your eyes with your palms over them

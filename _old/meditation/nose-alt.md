Close your eyes
Block one nostril with your thumb
Breathe in with nostril
Change nostril and breathe out
Block other nostril with your index and pinky
Breathe in with the nostril
Change nostril and breathe out
Keep doing until you feel you're done
Do it until you're done

Sit with your slowed thoughts
Feel the slowness of your breath
Rub your palms
Put them over your eyes 
Slowly breathe in and out and slowly open your eyes
Sit up straight

# Trade Up Screen
## Info
- You can combine your cards to get rewards, which are typically cards of higher rarity. There are three different types of trade-ups. **Regular**, **Random**, **Legendary**. In Regular Trade-Ups you obtain a card of your choice. In Random Trade-Ups you can't choose the card you obtain but it costs less cards to craft. Legendary Trade-Ups are used exclusively to recycle your extra legendaries. (Trade-Ups calculate the clan of the card based on the clans of the cards provided, Trade Tokens count towards all clans)
- Trade Tokens are used in place of regular cards. There are four types that correspond with the in-game rarities \[Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary]. To obtain Trade Tokens you can convert excess cards directly or obtain them as rewards.

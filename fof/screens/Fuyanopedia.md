# General
- When you go onto the Fuyanopedia camera will look on top of it from bird's eye view and it opens

- You'll see a little bit of the table from behind

- Four buttons on left page 
	- Achievements
	- Dictionary
	- Profile
	- Lore Books
- On the right page it shows the description, maybe a preview of the next page

- When you click one of the buttons it flips the page, same animation for each button it would just say a number different number at bottom of screen

- In book drawn arrow to go back to the starter page on the left (top or bottom)

# Lore Books
- Unlocked by "doing things"
- Name of lore book appears on left, click on it for info to show up on right
- Both sides are scrollable
- It's that easy
- Always in same order, not available books are greyed out buttons
- Collected number in top right of the left page
- Lore Books are collected by achievements, buying etc

# Dictionary
## Options
- Keywords & Abilities
- Stats

- When you click on it flips to the page

- Bookmarks to jump between stats/unique abilities etc

## Stats
### Default Drawings
- Kuba draws each type of card and it's drawn onto the page
- Unit (Decays in 12 Turns)
- Spell 
- Spawner (Decays in 12 Turns)
- Wall (Set Decay Date)
- Turret (Decays in 8 Turns)
- Ritual

### How it works
- When you first open the page it defaults to unit
- Left side is the buttons, right side is the most basic card of that type with the stats
- Arrow drawn from each stat and like a text bubble with a description of the stat
- Gives a little explanation at the bottom of the right page of what the card type

## Keywords & Abilities
### Bookmarks
- Static Abilities
- Unique Abilities
- Instant Effects
- Status Effects
- Ability Triggers

### How it works?
- 5 bookmarks appear at the top, when you select a bookmark ->
- All the names of the abilities/effects appear on the left (this can be a scrollable page)
- When you select a ability/effect it will appear on the right maybe with a little simulation/video of the game showing what it does and an explanation
- Title of ability/effect on top of right page, video under and explanation under that

**If only two things in dictionary look stupid mash stats and keywords & abilities**

# Achievements

- Whenever you finish an achievement you automatically gain the rewards

- When you click a bookmark it flips to the next page, closes the current achievment layer and shows nothing on top and shows the first achievement layer for the filter

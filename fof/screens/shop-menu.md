- When you enter the shop camera moves to like eye level at a bar stool and the bartender plays a voice line
- Packs/[[Fuyancoin/FC]]/Customization/Deals

- Four signs (or bottles I want) are used to swap between shelves behind the bartender, the signs are on the counter when you click one it rotates the shelf to that section
- When you are on the specific shelf the sign says Back and take you back to the shop? Packs signs however turn into Open Packs and Cosmetics turns into Customize Cosmetics, the sign will change shape or color
- Default shop position is just random

# Packs Menu
- (7?) Packs are shown at a time
- Half the shelf is like dedicated to a note that explains what each pack contains when you click on it on the left
- The packs are displayed on the right
- Buy pack button on the poster, slider with 1 to 20 that changes how many packs you buy
- If you don't have enough funds text appears and says you don't have enough and button is greyed out

# Deals Menu
- 5 Posters on 1 page, each poster is a self-contained deal that displays the information and a buy button. Up and down like button thingy next to bartender guy that moves the shelf up and down
- If you swap to a different shop menu it will go down to the base level and move over normally

## How It Works

- Shows price and name 
- Up is greyed out first
- Go down to go to the next one

## UI Menu in the middle of the screen

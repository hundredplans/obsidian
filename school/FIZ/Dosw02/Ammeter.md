- Used to measure Amps ([[Current]])
- Have to be placed "Inside" the flow / current
- Part of the circuit
- Disconnect before plugging it in
- Make sure to connect to the metal parts
	- Black is negative
	- Red is positive

- Internal Resistance of an Ammeter can cause measurement results to be messed up
- Can even alter the current is it's significant enough
- Known as the "loading effect"
- Have to select the correct range to minimise errors due to internal resistance

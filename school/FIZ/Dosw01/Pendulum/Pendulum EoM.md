Equation of Motion of a Pendulum
![[equation_of_motion_of_pendulum1.png]]

I = [[Moment of Inertia]]
d<sup>2</sup>θ / dt<sup>2</sup> = Angular Acceleration ([[Rotational Motion of a Rigid Body]])
m = Mass of pendulum
g = Acceleration due to gravity
d = Distance from pivot of pendulum (top part) to center of mass (bob/bottom thingie)
θ = Vertical Angular Displacement ([[Rotational Motion of a Rigid Body]])

For small angles sin(θ) ≈ θ, we can remove it from the equation

ω = Angular Frequency = 2PI / T = How fast per radians in second is your pendulum moving
ω<sup>2</sup> = mgd / I (For some reason, dude just trust me)

Thus we have 
- d<sup>2</sup>θ / dt<sup>2</sup> + ω<sup>2</sup>θ

We can solve for T because ω<sup>2</sup> = (2PI / T)<sup>2</sup> (Algebra)

All this does is show how the period of a pendulum (T) is dependant on
- Inertia (I)
- Mass (m)
- Acceleration due to gravity (g)
- Distance from pivot of pendulum (d)

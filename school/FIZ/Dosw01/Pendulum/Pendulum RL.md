Reduced Length of a Pendulum

The length of a simple pendulum (fake physics pendulum, ideal scenario) that has the same period as the physical pendulum (real, the string has mass)

To find the reduced length L of a physical pendulum
**L = I / md**
- I = [[Moment of Inertia]]
- m = Mass of pendulum
- d = Distance from pivot of pendulum (top part) to center of mass (bob/bottom thingie)

Period for a simple pendulum -> [[Pendulum Period]] T = equation
Period for a physical pendulum -> [[Pendulum EoM]] (bottom picture)

If we equal the two equations for simple and physical we get **L = I / md**

This equation is useful for simplifying equations of physical pendulums into simple pendulums (unconfirmed conclusion)

# Domain
- Denominator != 0
- Sqrt >= 0
- Abs
	- Keep signs and do x >= 0
	- Flip signs and do x < 0
	- Now you have to simultaenous domains you need to calculate
	- For unflipped signs your result has to meet x >= 0 and for flipped it has to meet x < 0
- log > 0
- D:(-2, 0) U (1, 5) *-> Example Notation*
# Roots
- When you find roots (x + 1)(x - 1) fill in for x = 0, x < 1 and x > 1
- Check if the result is positive or negative to know if it's inside your Domain

# Combining Domains
- Sometimes have to be simultaenously true, sometimes need either to be true
- For example abs is judged independently

# Trig Domains
- sin(x), cos(x) -> x e R
- arcsin(x), arccos(x) -> x e \[-1, 1]
	- Do -> -1 <= x <= 1

# Exponents
- a<sup>x</sup> = a<sup>y</sup> -> x = y
- a e (0, 1) -> a<sup>x</sup> <= a<sup>y</sup> -> x >= y *-> Flip Signs*
- a e (1, âˆž) -> a<sup>x</sup> <= a<sup>y</sup> -> x <= y *-> Keep Signs*
- Works the same for Logarithms

# Solving Exponents
- n<sup>equation</sup> = 1 -> Equation = 0 to solve 
- You can flip signs of a divison by doing (x/y)<sup>-1</sup> 
- If you have multiple exponents on either side of equation multiplied by some x
	- Set exponents to a, b then do x<sub>1</sub>a + y<sub>1</sub>b = x<sub>2</sub>a + y<sub>2</sub>b 
	- Can also do it for quadratics and then find roots, then set what you find back to the exponent
		- 3<sup>x</sup> = 1, cause y = 1 (y is a root)
- If two exponents equal each other with different bases means exponent = 0

# Logarithms
- a<sup>log<sub>a</sub>(x)</sup> = x
- log<sub>a</sub>(a<sup>x</sup>) = x
- Explaining Log
	- a = base
	- x = result
	- y = exponent
	- a<sup>y</sup> = x
	- log<sub>a</sub>(x) = y
	- What exponent do I have to raise a to get x?
- Flipping signs works exactly the same as exponents (0 < a < 1, base) is flipped otherwise stays

# Trig Functions
- arcsin(sin(x)) = x

(2 + 3i) / (1 + 2i) -> Przez sprezenie mianownika (bottom)
(2 + 3i)(1 - 2i) / (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)

z = a + bi
z̄ = a - bi (Sprezenie / Conjugate)

For questions involving simple math with z do algebra then split imaginary and real seperate equations and find a, b based on those two equations and substitute back into z at the end

√-1 = i
√-4 = 2i

If there's no solution for b when you found a that means b can be any Imaginary number
eg. a = 2 then z = 2 + bi

The above also applies for Real numbers
eg. b = 0 then z = a + 0i

Remember to solve the trigonometry form ones all the way, especially De'Moivre
Sin
- Positive 0 -> PI
- Negative PI -> 2PI

Cos
- Positive 0 -> PI / 2
- Negative PI / 2 -> 3PI / 2
- Positive 3PI / 2 -> 2PI

cos(a) = cos(-a)
sin(a) = -sin(-a)

When you can't simplify cos, sin such as cos(pi / 10) you can leave it in that form

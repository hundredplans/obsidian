Optimization is searching for the extreme of a function

Maximizing -> Searching for largest value of f(x)
Minimizing -> Searching for smallest value of f(x)

Optimization Multicriterial -> Optimising for multiple criteria
Optimization Multimodal -> Gives more than one response (Google / GPT)

Heuristic -> Used for problems with a lot of complex parts, doesn't have a guarantee of finding an optimal solution

Algorithm Monte Carlo -> The more attempts you do the more likely is the value approach the result
Algorithm Las Vegas -> Uses a randomised variable to quicken results, used when solution is guaranteed for example Quicksort

Metaheuristic -> How to construct a heuristic
- First initialise your data
- Repeat in a loop until fulfilled
	- Randomly modify your solution
- Rate your solution with a rating function

``` c++
switch (variable) {
	case 1:
	// code
	break;
	case 2:
	// code
	break;
	default:
	// code
}
```

break is necessary to stop further execution of the switch statement
default is used if no other cases match, doesn't require a break;
the case and code block do not have to be tab-seperated / it's not stylish?

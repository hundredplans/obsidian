Also known as the *Parallel Axis Theorem*

Moment of inertia of a parallel axis I<sub>O'</sub>:
	- I<sub>O</sub> -> Axis passing through the center of mass
	- m -> Mass of the object
	- d -> Distance between the two parallel axis
	

the moment of inertia of the axis passing through the center of mass of the object + mass by distance squared

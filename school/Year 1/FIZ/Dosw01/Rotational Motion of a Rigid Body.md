Angular Displacement (Przesuniecie Katowe?) -> A rotation between the body's new position and it's current position measured in radians (full spin would be 2PI)

Angular Velocity (Predkosc Katowa) -> Velocity with the angle always tangential to the circle / Change in angle with respect to time (d/dt)

Angular Acceleration (Przyspieszenie Katowe) -> The change in angular velocity with respect to time due to the application of a force on the rigid body

# Inertia
A body resists change in it's current state
- Moving body doesn't want to stop
- Still body doesn't want to start moving

Affected by mass and distribution of mass relative to the axis around which the body rotates (?)
Distance of centre of mass to axis of rotation affects rotational inertia (Big Distance = Big Inertia)

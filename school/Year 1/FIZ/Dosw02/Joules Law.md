- Heat generated is proportional to: 
	- Resistance of the wire
	- The time for which the [[Current]] flows
	- Square of the current flowing
- If the same current is passed for the same amount of time through different resistors
	- Heat is proportional to the [[Resistor]] [[Resistance]]

- Q = I<sup>2</sup> Rt
	- Q = Amount of heat generated by Joule's Law (Joule Heating)
	- I = Current
	- R = Resistance
	- t = Time

- When resistance and time is constant: Q ∝ I<sup>2</sup>
- When resistance and current is constant: Q ∝ t
- When current and time is constant: Q ∝ R

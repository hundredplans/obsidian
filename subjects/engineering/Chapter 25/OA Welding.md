#### Explanation
1. [[Acetylene]] and Oxygen are mixed to make an [[OA Welding Flame]]
2. The [[OA Welding Flame]] melts and fuses the two materials
3. [[Filler Rods]] can be used
4. [[Slag]] forms if [[Flux]] is used
5. Used for [[Light-Gauge Metals]], steel pipes, vehicle repairs
6. Not good for [[Heavy-Gauge Metals]] and thick materials as it's not hot enough
7. Not usually automated

#### Advantages
- Portable as it's not electrical
- Easy to learn and use
- Cheaper than other welding methods
- Can be used on a lot of metals
- Can be used for [[Welding]], [[Cutting]], [[Brazing]] and [[Soldering]]

#### Disadvantages
- [[Welds]] can often have a rough apperance
- Heat may warp some materials
- Not easily automatable

#### Safety
##### Risks
- Gas Explosion
- Skin Burns
- Eye Damage
- Breathing Difficulties

##### Safety Features
- Oxygen cylinder is black with white cap, Oxyacetylene is maroon
- Oxygen gas hose is blue, acetylene hose is red
- [[Acetylene]] is dissolved into Acetone as it explodes when compressed

##### Safety Precautions
- Welding goggles to protect from hot metal particles and bright lights
- Welding gloves to protect from hot metal particles
- Masks to protect against fumes

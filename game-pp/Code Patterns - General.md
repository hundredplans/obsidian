# Why use patterns?
- So your code works with any class
- Flexibility, patterns can be extended from two pieces of code communicating to more

# Possible Approaches
- Keep code flexible until the design settles then add [[Abstractions]]
- Remember perfomance optimization costs flexibility & vice-versa

# When & How to [[Prototype]]
-  Mark your prototyped code and be aware it's temporary. By design it can't be maintained and therefore shouldn't

# The Balance
1. Long-term Dev Speed (Architechture)
2. Perfomance Speed (Hardware)
3. Short-term Dev Speed (New Features/Redesigns)
